# Authentication Microservice
This microservice is built using the following technologies, frameworks, and tools:

* Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as a software design approach.
* Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a software development process.
* Clean Architecture to create the structure of the microservice.
* FastAPI as a web framework.
* Django ORM to interact with the database.
* PostgreSQL as the database.
* Redis as the caching system and in-memory table.
* Celery or Apache Kafka as the message broker.

## Overview
The Authentication Microservice is a web-based application built to provide authentication functionality for other microservices in a distributed system. The service uses a domain-driven design approach to ensure that the application is developed with a clear understanding of the business domain and requirements.

## Technologies
### FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide high performance and automatic validation of request data.

### Django ORM
The Django Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a high-level Python library that allows developers to interact with databases using Python code rather than SQL. It provides a simple and efficient way to access and manage data in a relational database.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system that is widely used in web applications. It provides features such as transactions, concurrency control, and data integrity to ensure that data is consistent and reliable.

### Redis
Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It provides a fast and efficient way to store and retrieve data, and it supports a variety of data structures such as strings, hashes, and lists.

### Celery or Apache Kafka
Celery is an open-source, distributed task queue that allows developers to run asynchronous tasks in the background. It provides a simple and efficient way to perform long-running or resource-intensive tasks, such as sending emails or generating reports.

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows developers to build real-time streaming applications. It provides a scalable and fault-tolerant way to process and store streams of data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Authentication Microservice, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Set up the database:

```bash
createdb authentication_microservice
```
Set up the environment variables:

```bash
export DB_NAME=authentication_microservice
export DB_USER=your_database_username
export DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
export DB_HOST=your_database_host
export DB_PORT=your_database_port
export REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
```
Run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
Start the server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
## Conclusion
The Authentication Microservice provides a reliable and secure way to authenticate users in a distributed system. It is built using modern technologies and follows best practices to ensure that the application is scalable, maintainable, and robust.Use celery or apache kafka as message brocker.
